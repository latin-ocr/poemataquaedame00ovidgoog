Aurora, mourning lor her son Memnon, slain by Achilles, obtains
that his ashes shall become birds, while her tears are changed to
dew (576-622). AEneas at Delphi is told by'Anius‚ priest of
Apollo, of his daughters' transformation into doves while fleeing
from the power ol Agamemnon (623-674); and at his departing
receives from him a bowl engraved with the sels-devotion os Orion’s
daughters, sacrificed lor Thebes, out of whose ashes sprang the
youths Corona (675—699). Thence sailing to Crete and Italy, he
passes at Actium the stone image oi the judge Ambracus, and
Dodona where the sons ol Molossus took the form ol birds
(700-718). On the coast ol Sicily he nears the rockol the
monster Scylla, once the beautiful daughter of Phorcus, who hears
from her attendant nymph Galatea (daughter ol Nereus and Doris)

tiful youth ol Sicily, loved and was loved by Galatea But the
giant Polyphemus had likewise conceiwed a wild passion lorber,
which he utters in song (750-869); and seeiug them as they are
scaled together in a wood‚ he is filled with jealousy‚ and casts a
rock from AEtna upon them, by which Acis is crushed, aud his
blood, oozing beneath the rock, becomes a river (870-897).

[Thereaften as Scylla paces the shore, she is seen aud pursued
by Glaucus, who relates to her the story ol his own transformation
from a mortal to a sea-divinity (898·968). Going theu to Circe, a
mistress of enchantments, he entreats her to aid his suit ol Scylla3
but she in jealousy‚ because she herself loved Glaucus, so en·
chanted the waters Scylla used to bathe, that she was converted to
a foul monster, girt about the loins with wild dogs‚ aud afterwards
(lest she might harm AEneas’ fleet) to a rock (XIV. 1-74).]

ACIS erat Fauno nymphaque Symaethide cretus,
magna quidem patrisque sui matrisque voluptas,
nostra tamen major, nam me sibijunxerat uni.
