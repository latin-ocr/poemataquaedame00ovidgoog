VI. Perseus nrm Annonem.

Acursrus king of Argos, had been warned that he should be
dethroned and slain by the child of his daughter Danae, whom
therefore, to elude the oracle‚ he contined in a dungeon with brazen
walis. But Jupiter gained admissiou in the form of a shower oi
gold, and Danae became the mother oi Perseus. Being shut with
the child - then four years oi age -in a chest, or coffer, and cast
into the sea, she drifted to the island oi Seriphos, where the boy
grew up, and was sent crastily by the tyrant oi the island for the
head oi the Gorgon Medusa. In this enterprise he was helped
and delivered by the friendly care oi the divinities Mercury and
Minerva, who armed him ior his task, gave him the power ot' flight,
and made him invulnerable and invincible. (See, for an admirable
narrative of the adventure, Kingsley's “Heroes,'' and “Andro-
meda.'')
