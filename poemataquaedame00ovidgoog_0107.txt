[Aeni-:cous continuing the discourse, tells of the transforma· ⁴
tions of Proteus, and of Meua, daughter of Eresichthon, who
(receiving this power from Neptune) long, by cheats and wiles,
sustained her father cursed with extreme tage ol hunger sor the
violation ol a grove os Ceres (v111.725-884). And as Theseus
inquires the cause ol his broken horn, Achelous replies that con·
tending once with Hercules lor the possession ol Deianira, sister
of Meleager, that horn had been wrested oh} and, being filled by¹
the Naiads with autumn fruits, became the hom of Plenty (IX-
1-100). ln deience of the same Dejanira, Hercules had once
slain the centaur Nessus, who, dying, gave her a tunic stained
with his blood, mixed with venom of the Lernaean hydra, which (he
said) would recall her husband’s love ii ever it should vander or
cool (ror-133).]

Asterward, Hercules being about to wed Iole, daughter oi Eury·
tus, Dejanira sent to him this tunicas a marriage gift. But when
it took heat from the altar flames as he was about to sacrifice, Her-
cules, being in extreme torment, and unable to tear it oti, cast into ,
the sea the bearer of the gili, Lichas, who was converted into a
rock, retaining his human form (134-227). Then Hercules, build-
ing a great funeral pile upon Mount OEta ol Thessaly, burned him·
sels thereon; and, his mortal parts being purged away, was'
received into the company os the gods (aad-272).
