of the productive power oi the soil, who seeks her child Proser-
pina (Persephone, called also ΚοΡὴ, tlte martian), stolen from her
sight by the king of the lower world, and only restored to her by
Jupiter sor six months oi each year. By this parable the ancients
understood the annual sowing os the grain-harvest, by which the
corn is hidden in the ground through the winter months, but re-
stored in spring to sunlight, and ripening to the harvest, in which
the yearly festival os Ceres is celebrated with religious rites.
