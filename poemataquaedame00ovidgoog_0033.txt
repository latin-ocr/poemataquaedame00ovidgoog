18 11. The Adventare qs Phaethon. [Mennn.

II. Tne Anvnnrunn on Pnnnnnon.

[Amono the creatures generated from the soil of the earth after
the Deluge‚ had been the serpent Python, slain by Apollo, who
thereon instituted the Pythian games: the prize of victory, first
the oak-leaf, was afterwards the laurel, sacred to Apollo, being the
nymph Daphne, loved by him, and changed to that form to escape
his pursuit- lo, daughter of the river-god inachus, beloved by
Jupiter, is changed into a heifer by him, to escape the jealousy of
Juno; but is put by her in charge of Argus of the hundred eyes,
who being soothed to sleep by Mercury -who sings the story of
Syrinx converted to a water-reed to avoid the pursuit of Pan -is
slain by him, and his hundred eyes are setin the peacock’s tail.
lo, fleeing to Egypt, becomes the goddess lsis, and the mother of
Epaphus ; who denies against Phaethon his boast to be son of the
Suu-god, as avouched by his mother Clymene (l. 416-779).] '

The palace of the Sun described(ll. 1-18). Phoebus, the god of ¹

Day‚ receives Phaethon with affection, and owns him as his son,
promising by oath to give him whatever boon he should desire

. (tp-46). Phaethon demands the charge of the chariot and horses of

the Sun for a single day, persisting in spite of his father’s warning
and appeal (47-102). He mounts, and attempts the celestial way:

dread forms of the Zodiac: the steeds dash wildly from the path Ἴ
(103-205). Terror and devastation caused hythe fiery chariot: ,
blasting of mountains and rivers, and alarm of Neptune himself ; l

Earth appeals to Jupiter, who blasts Phaethon with a thunderbolt
(κού-324). His sisters are converted to poplars, and their tears '
to amber (325-366); while his kinsman Cygnus, bewailing the
calamity, becomes a Swan (367-380). The Suu, in grief and wrath,

· hides his head from the earth ; but, entreated by the gods and Ἰ

commanded by Jupiter, collects again his scattered steeds, to
resume their wouted course (381-400).

REGIA Solis erat sublimibus alta columnis,

clara micante auro flammasque imitante pyrppo‚ ,

cujus ebur nitidum fastigia summa tegebatt

argenti bifores radiabant lumine valvae.

materiam superabat opus; nam Mulciber illic ς
aequora caelarat medias cingentia terras,
