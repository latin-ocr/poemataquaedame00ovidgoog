The tale os Perseus (like that os Hercules and many other
heroes) represents the daily course ol theson, in conflict with the
powers ol darkness and storm. The harpe is his gleaming ray;
the Graiae are the twilight; the Gorgons are the stom-cloud,
which rests upon the bosom ol the sea-wave, and is cloven by the
“golden sword '’ os the lightning. The jagged edges of the cloud,
and the crimson stream which pours from it in the glnw of suaset,
help out the features nl the image.
