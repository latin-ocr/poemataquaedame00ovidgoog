[Dacsrvrwo the daughters of PeliaS, Jason’s enemy, by a
similar miracle 'wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their father's death (VII. 297-349). Eseaping by means oi winged
dragous, and passing over the scene oi many transformatione,
Medea comes to Athens, whence (her attempted poisoning oi
Theseus being soiled by the recognition oi his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350-424). A feast is celebrated in honoros
[Theseus’ exploits ; and hostility ensuing with Minos (Europa’s son)
of Crete, Cephalus is sent as envoy to AEgina3 ¹to whom the aged
, AEacus relates the marvellous transformation oi ant's to men (called
Myrmidons), after his realm had been ravaged by pestilence (425-
660). Now Cephalus had received from his wife Procris a hound
and a dart that never missed its aim; and, as he delighted greatly
in hunting, Procris being jealous watched him from a thicket; and
he, taking it ior the movement of some wild creature, shot her with
that dart which was her own gift (661-865). Minos, making war
on Athens to avenge the slaying of his son AndrogeoS, comes first
to Megara3 where Scylla, daughter of the king Nisus, out of love
sor Minos euts the purple lock on which her father's kingdom and
lile depend. Disdained by Minos, she is changed to a sea-mew,
aud Nisus toan osprey (V111.1—151).]

Theseus, in his escape from the Cretan labyrinth, had borne
away Ariadne, daughter oi Minos; who, sorsaken by him, is com·
forted by Bacchus, who sets her coronet among the stars (152-182).
Daedalus, builder of the labyrinth, being imprisoned, escapes with
his son learus by means of wings fastened with wax; but icarus,
soaring too near the sun, and the wax melting, salls into the sea
named for him (183-234). His fallis gladly seen by Perdix, once
sister’s son to Daedalus, aud slain by him out of envy, but changed
by Minerva to a partridge (2 35-259). ⁹
