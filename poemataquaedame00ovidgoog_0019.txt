4 Introduction.

is apparently the first attempt of human thought to deal systemati· ,

cally with the phenomena oi nature-so as, in a. manner, to
account for things- before men were sufficiently free from super·
stition to reject the early sables. The tides of several Greek works
ol the same kind are known; and Virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue,
puts a similar song into the mouth of Silenus.

Any thing like a real belief in these sables had passed away long
before the time of Ovid. He was the popular poet osa sensual
and artificial age, who found in these creatione of ancient lancy
a group oi subjects suited to his graceiul, ornate, and marvellously
facile'style os narrative, and who did not hesitate to alteror dress
them up to suit his purpose. The ‘⁴ Metamorphoses '² -Librr' xv.
Metamorphoseon (a Greek genitive)-is the most abundant and
rich collection of these sables that exists. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, often debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to these myths;
but are wonderfullyfluent, easy, and melodious in their language, and
show a skill of versification which seems never to halt or weary.
The poem begins with the first origin of things from chaos, the
iour ages of gold, silver, brass, and iron, the deluge, followed by the
graceful and picturasque version of the tales of gods and heroes,
through a long narrative-about 12,000 verses in all—ending
with the apotheosis of Caesar, as the sequel of the tale of Troy.
The series purports to be chronological; but the order is olten
arbitrary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case with an author rer diversrbsimos r'n merisne unius
corporat collugentem (Quint. iv. 1, 77).

The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek
mythology dressed up in Roman names. It is not necessary to
remind the render that the stories here told related to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis, and the other members oi the Greek Olympus,
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractione of

· the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless, in commenting upon ovid,

it is impossible to avoid making use of the names in the same
sense that he did-the names long familiar in modern litera·
ture, which took them from the Romans and not the Greeks.
