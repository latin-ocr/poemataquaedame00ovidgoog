[AEwsns had passed, on the coast of Italy, the isle of the Cer-
copes, turned by Jupiter into apes (XIV. 75-100)‚ and coming to
Cumae, finds the Sibyl Amalthea, daughter of Scylla, who relatas
that, being loved by Apollo, he had granted her wish to live so
many years as the grains of saud iu her hand (ror-153). Arriving
at Cajetas, he meets Macareus, an old companion of Ulysses, who
relates the adventure of the Cyclops and the enchantments of
Circe, at whose palace they had remained a full year (1 54-312).
During this time, Circe tells of Picus, son of Saturn, whom, not
returning her love, she had converted to a woodpeclrer, and his
companions to various beasts, while his wife Canens wasted into
air (313-440). ln the wars which followed AEneas’ arrival in
Latium, Diomed refuses aid to Turnus, but his companions, desir-

to white iu the urn (XV. 1-59)]. At Heraclea Pythagoras, exiled
from Samos, instructs him in the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and the law which forbids all shedding of blood. This was
unknown iu the goldeu age, but began with the slaughter of
animals for food (75-142). Pythagoras - recalling his own former
’ existence as Euphorbus (slain by Menelaus before Troy)-·teaches
that all life incessantly passes from one to another form ; all things
are in flux and change- the heavenly bodies, the seasons types of
human life, the elements with their transmutatious, the vast changes
on the face of the earth (237-277). [These changes detalled:
