[Huncuues returning from the Calydoniae Hunt, ls entertained
with his friends by the river-god Achelous, who recounts the fate ol
certain nymphs, turned into rocks and islands. These prodigies
are mocked by Pirithous, son of Ixion, who is among them. To
silence his cavil, Lelex relates the following tale (58o619).]

Jupiter and Mercury, journeying once in Phrygia, were refused
hospitality by all the inhabitants ofa certain place, except two
pious rustics, Philemon and his wife Baucis, who provide s'uch
entertainment as they are able (oze-688). While the inhospitable
town was drowned in a marsh‚ the poor hut of Philemon became
a temple, of which he and his wife were made attendants 3 until in
a good old age they were both transformed to trees, he to an oak
ancl she to a linden (689-724).

TILIAE contermina quercus

collibus est Phrygiis, modico circumdata muro-‚s

haud procul huic stagnum est, tellus habitabilis olim,
nunc celebres mergis fulicisque palustribus undae. ⁶²3
Juppiter huc specie mortali, cumque parente
venit Atlantiades, positis caducifer ulis. “
mille domos adiere, locum requiemque ,petentest
mille domos clausere serae. Tamen una recepit,
parva quidem, stipulis et canna tecta palustris ⁶³0
sed pia Baucis anus parilique aetate Philemon v
illa sunt annis juncti juvenilibus, illa
consenuere casa3 paupertatemque fatendo
effecere levem, nec iniqua mente ferendo.
nec refert, dominos illic, famulosne requirasr ⁶35
tota domus duo suut, idem parentque jubentque. .

Ergo ubi caelicolae parvos tetigere penates,
summissoque humiles intrarunt vertice postes,
membra senex posito jussit relevare sedili,
