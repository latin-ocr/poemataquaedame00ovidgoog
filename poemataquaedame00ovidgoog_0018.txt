With the primitive (fetichistic) notion of a separate life in
every object, anti tlte human soul differing in no essential regard
from the life that dwells in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit
of man, beast, or plant as passing from one dwelling to another, ior
a longer or shorter stay. Such a transmigration was, in fact,
taught as a creed by the school of Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.

‹ 1-487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine of transmigration
into the very life of other animale, the Greeks held to the identity
and continuity oi the human soul, which after death had its abode ἵ
assigned in the Lower World. The metamorphosis, therefore,
is only an occasional miracle, not a real metempsychosis;† it did
not alter essentially' the ordinary course of human life, but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the life os
external nature; or, in a certain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings oi human ¹fancy, to account sor tbe first creation of plants
and animale, or other striking phenornens of the natural world, -a
clear water-spring in a little island (Arethusa), a mountain ridge
ci pecoliar shape (A tlas), a bird of plaintive note (Philomela), or
arock weeping with perpetual springs (Niobe).

To give something like system, order, and development to this
world of table seems to have been a favorite aim of poetical corn-
position with the ancieuts. This aim is partly religious, and , partly
solentino-if that can be called-scientim which only nlls with
fancies avoid that no science yet exists to iill. Thus the ‘⁴ Theo· ¹

of gods and heroes-making a sortes pagan “ Genesis ”-in a
