ln is supposedthat most classes who read Ovid at all, will read

Ovid before any other latin poet; and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -that is, with
a knowledge of its rhythmical structure,-— a lew directions will
here be given ior scanning at sight, or by ear ; which, with a little
practice, will be found an easy, almost mechanical process.

lt is necessary, first, sor the learner to understand the nature
ol the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as the
rhythmical divisione oi a piece os music (ξ 'l'l); also, to be familiar
with the general rules ol Quantity and Accent (ἐξ 3, 4).* Besides
this, the teacher should explain aud illustrate, so sar as may be
necessary, the structure os the hexameter (ξ 82, a), reading from
the textos the poem itselt, until its 'peculiar movement has become
familiar to the learner's ear. lt will now be observed-

1. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in tlte
first leals of tlte verse. With very rare exceptions, the last two
ieet, and generally the last three, are accented in verse exactly as

n they would be in prose: that is, the Arsit (tirst syllable) oi the
soot corresponds with the natural or prose accent oi the word.

2. That in hexameter verse tlte thirdsoot (rarely the fourth

ζ instead) regularly begins wille tlte last syllable of a word. Thus,
while the last hali ol averse is almost always accented as in prose,
the first halt very seldom is. The slight pause interrupting the
soot at the end os the word is called a casural pause (ξ 79, 5);
and is the most important point that distinguishes the movement
os 'verse from that ol prose. The pause in the third loot (less
commonly the fourth) u'sually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, and is called the principal caesura.

3. That whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, there
must le a daem. This becomes a most convenient rule‚ as soon
as the pronunciation oi even the communest words is known, in

*To these it may be well to edd the quantity oi final syllables (9 ¹18. a). The
learner should aleo be habitum to en aestuate pronunciation oi worda according to their
prose meent.
