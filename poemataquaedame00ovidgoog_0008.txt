NOTE.

Tms Selection follows generally the text ol' Merkel (1866), the
reading os Siebelis being preferred in' one or two instances. We
have endeavored to exhibit¹ as sar es possible within our limite the

variety of Ovid's style end genius, end especially to preserve the

more interesting biographical hints of the Amores and the Tristia.
The greater portion os the book is however made up, necessarily,
from the Metamorphoses, of which we heve taken about a third.
By help os the Argument‚ which is given in full, we aim not merely
to show the connection os the tales end the ingenuity'of the transi·
tione-necessary to comprehend the poem as a whole-but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture os the
Greek mythology; at least ol those narrativee which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind end have entered more
or less into every modern literature.

The grammatical references ere to Allen and Greenough’s and
Gildersleeve's Latin Gremmers.
