§HORTER POEMS.

1. Tua Fnsrr.

Tun word fasti, properly applied to those days of the year on
which it was permitted (scis) to transact public business, came to
be applied to the Roman Calendar, or systematic arrangement
and classification of the days of each mouth. Ovid's purpose in
this poem was to cast this calendar into a poetic form, describ·
ing whatever was peculiar and ,characteristic in the Roman mages,
-as festivals aud rites,-aud working into it whatever traditione
anri myths were current among the people· The Roman religion

was so meagre in the elements of fable, that its mythology, as pre-
sented in this work, is hardly more than a clumsy adaptation and
vamping over of Grecian myths. lt was, however, as rich iu
form and ceremonial as it was poor in story; and the most valu-
able aud original portions of the Fasti are those which describe
fragments of these primitive rites, which had managed to survive
the inroad of the more fashionable Greek and Oriental forms of
worship, and still lingered in the community. Some of them,
indeed, held their own for centuries longer, and some were
transformed and adopted into the Christian calendar.

Only six books of the Fasti, containing the months from Jan-
uary to June inclusive, are extant lt is a much disputed question
whether the other six books have been lost, or were never written.
lt is probable that they were written in the rough, but unfinished
at the time of the poet's exile, aud never published. At any rate,
there are no citations in ancient authors from any but the first
six books.

The following extracts from the fourth book (April) contain a
description of two very ancient festivals, with the traditioual
account of the founding of Rome, introduced in the usual manner
of the poet.

1. The Festzbal (ψ’ Pales (April 21).

ΟΧ abiit, oriturque Aurora. Parilia poscort ι
Non poscor frustra, si favet alma Pales.
