XI.101.] Bacchus in Phrygio.

· XVII. Tus. Sronv oF Mrnhs.  
[Boou XI.-85-193.]

Pnocssntuu irom Thrace into Phrygia, Bacchus is deserted by
Silenus, whom king Midas restores to him, and so receives from
Bacchus whatever boon he should desire. Choosing that whatever
he touched might become gold, Midas presently finds his gift a
curse; but by help oi the god is freed srom it on bathing in the
river Pactolus, whose sands thencesorth become gold (85-145).
Afterwards, frequenting woods and lonely places, he became
witness os a contest for the palm of music between Pan and
Apollo. By TmoluS, the mountain-god, Apollo is judged vict0r;
and Midas pronouncing for Pan, his ears are by Apollo lengthened .
into ass’s ears (146-179); the secret os which being by his servant
whispered to the earth, there sprang up reeds, which in their
rustling told the shame os Midas (180-193).

NEC satis hoc Baccho est: ipsos quoque deserit Ι

agros

cumque choro meliore sui vineta Timoli ·
Pactolonque petit—quamvis non aureus illo
tempore, nec caris erat invidiosus arenis. ,
hunc assueta cohors satyri bacchaeque frequentant,
at Silenus abest. Titubantem annisque meroque 90
ruricolae cepere Phryges, vinctumque coronis
ad regem duxere Midan, cui Thracius Orpheus
orgia tradiderat cum Cecropio Eumolpo.
qui simul agnovit socium comitemque sacrorum,
hospitis adventu festum genialiter egit 95
per bis quinque dies et junctas ordine noctes.

Et jam stellarum sublime coegerat agmen
Lucifer undecimus, Lydos cum laetus in agros
rex venit, et juveni Silenum reddit alumno.
huic deus optandi gratum, sed inutile, iecit 100
muneris arbitrium, gaudens altore recepto. ·
