lv. ro] The Poet’s Autobziigraphy. 271⁹

68. rabula, scandal.

78.' lustris: as the lustrum is generally reckoned at five years,
this would make his father ninety at the time of his death (but see
below, note to v. 95).

80. justa, due (funeral) riter.

8 5. ailquid nlsl, something herides.

88. ln Stygio foro, ἐκ the court of Pluto.

95. ortus, birth. -Pleaea ollva: the reward to the victor in
the Olympio games (held in the territory of Pisa) was a crown ol
wild olive. As these gemes came once in four yearS, decos victor
would naturally mean lorty years ; he was, however, fifty at the time
os his banishment. and we can account sor the discrepancy only by
supposlng that he reckoned the Olympiad at five years, an almost

inconceivable blunder. Mommsen explains it, however (Rhm.
Chron. p. 170). by calling attention to the confusion os the ancients

themselves in regard to the expression quinto quoque anno, for the
period in the Julian calendar: “the poet,’' he says, “rightly sup
posed that the Olympiad and the Julian lustra [decem lustris perac-
- tis, Ibis. 1]‚ were ol equal length, aud very wrongly supposed the
latter to be five years.”

97. ad laeva, l. e. as one sails out from the Propontis (Mar-
mora).

106. temporis erma, i. e. of the exigency, or the new lile into
which he was thrown.

114. elo, even thus.

122. ab exsequiis, aster the Jiaeneral.

126. maligna, grudging.

129. vert limits quid.
