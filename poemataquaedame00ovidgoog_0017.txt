2 Introduction to the

whose family history or personal adventures became the subject
os tales absolutely devoid ol any symbolical meaning. ln the
system found ln the Greek and Roman poets, nature is fullos
mythological-beings, grouped- as subjects ina monarchy -about
the one celestial or royal family, which has its abode on Mount

Olympus. The King of Heaven, Zeus (Jupr'tcr), with his sister-
* queen HERE (June), is the child of Knouos (Saturn) or Time,

who again is the son of Ounnuos and GA1A (Heaven and Earth),
beyond which imagination did not seek to go. His brothers are
Poscmou (Neptune) and Hanns (Pluto), kings of the Waters and
of the Lower World. His sisters are Dennunn (Ceres) and Hasna
(Vesta), queens of the Harvest and ol the Home. His sons are
ΑΡοιιο, god os Light, Anas (Mars) of strife, and Hennes
(Mercury) the Herald. His daughters are ΑΤΗΕΝΕ (Minerva),
Acunomrc (Venus), andAnrrn1s (Druna), goddesses of Wis-
dom, ol Leve, andos the Chase. These are the twelve great
divinities (dii majores). And about them, in nearer or remoter
kindred, are grouped the inferior deities, the heroes or demigodS,
their children by hals-mortal parentage‚ and the innumerable
progeny of fabulous beings inhabiting the kingdoms oi sky,
water, or earth. Δ
The other department os mythology is that with which this poem
chiefly deals. lt consists of the miracles and adventures ascribed
to these superhuman persons, - a vast field, in which ancient lancy
rioted as frecly as the modern fancy in novels and fairyoates.
Some of them may possibly be explained as a pictoresque way
os recounting natural phenomena, or as exaggerated tales of real
events. But in general they seem 'purely fictions os the imagina-
tion. In a 'very large proportion they take the formos metamor-
phoser, that is, transformations os men or other creatures into
various shapes 3 and this feature gives the subject and the title of
the present poem (see the first lines ol Book I.). It professes
simply to tell those stories which have in thern this clement of the
marvellous,-the transformations, particularly, of men into plants
or animals. But as nearly all myths introduce some such feature,
first or last, it manages to include nearly all the important ones ·
with more or less sulness. They are told ln a rambling discursive
way, one story leading to another by the slightest possible link
