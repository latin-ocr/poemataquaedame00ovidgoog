all cases where there are words of more than two syllables3 for Ι
thus a short syllable will often serve as a key to th'e entire structure Ι
of the verse.
For examples, we will take the first four lines of the poem.
1. In nnvafert sinimus rnntdtar dicere formas.
Here the last three words are scanned exactly as they read:
mutatas Ι dicere Ι formas. Of the others, datheus shows by its
accent that thei of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
must belong to the following font, nothing more is needed to show
that the verse will scan as follows : -
ln ndva Ι fert iniimus ΙΙ multatas Ι dicere Ι formas3
and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
position in the verse.
2. Corpora: Di, creptis - nam vos mutastis et allas-
The first word corpora, being a dactyl7 at once gives a correct start to*
the verse. The second foot, Dicoep-—is equally plain, as a spond9e3
and after this beginning, the rest of the verse scans of itself : - ¹ ’
Corpora: Ι Di, coepitis'll -nam Ι vos militastis et Ι illas.
3. Adspirate meis,· primaque ab origine mundi.
The first word, adspirate, is nearly as clear, as, when we remember
either the pronunciatien of adspira or the quantity of the a of the
first conjugation‚ we see that it contains three long syllables, a
spondee and the beginning ofa dactyl. The last three feet are
pronounced 'exactly as in prose (observing the elision) : -
Adspilratlt mdiis; ΙΙ pri imaqu’ ab diriglnd Ι mundi.
4 Α d mea perpltuum deddcitr tempora carmen.
Here the three last words form a perfect metrical series; and the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by the ἐσίω coming on the
first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is on the second.
Ad mda Ι ρεφόῑῠΙιιιη Ι deidncne Ι tempdrd Ι carmen.
These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all casea*l
if it were not for the frequent elision of the last syllable of words:
vin, in general, whenever a word endingen α vorvel or in m is
sollomd by a word beginning wz'th a ‘vowel or wart h. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to be
met, and requires the beginner to be constantly on the watch. If
he will now carefully compare the following lines, as metrically
ἢ divided‚ with the rules which have been given above, it is hoped
that he will have little difficulty hereafter.
