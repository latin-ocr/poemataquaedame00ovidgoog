X. 7.] Orpbeus aud Eurydice.

XIV. Onennus awo Eunvnrca.
[Boou X.-1-77.]

[Amnem mother oi Hercules, to entertain lole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the tale ol Hercules⁹ birth, which
was long delayed, but at last brought about by the artifice of Galan-
this, a waiting maid ; who, lor the falsehood she told, was turned
into a weasel by Ilithyia, whom she had deceived (IX. 273—323).
Iole relates in turn ol her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324-339). The restoring of Iolaus to youth, and the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children of Callirhoe, having moved the
displeasure of some of the gods, Jupiter reminds them os the pain-
t'ul old age of his own son Minos (φο-442). The tale is told of
Byblis, daughter ol Miletus (who had migrated, from Crete to Asial:
she, filled with a guilty love sor her brother Caunus, became a soun-
tain in Caria (443-665). lphis, daughter of Ligdus of Crete, having
been brought up as a youth to avoid her father's displeasirre that a
daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man
by lsis, and so became the husband of Ianthe (666-797).] .

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, after the marriage of lphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily, for she died srorn the
bite os a serpent. To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the shadows
of the lower World, where even the Furies are moved to tears at
his song, the pains of hell are stayed, and Proserpina is won to .
yield him back his'wife‚ only on condition that he shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
in his' eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and is not suffered
a second time to enter Hades (X. 1-77).

INDE per immensum croceo velatus amictu
aethera digreditur, Ciconumque Hymenaeus ad
, 9³3. .
tendit, et Orphea nequiquam voce vocatur.
adsuit ille quidem3 sed nec sollemnia verba,
nec laetos vultus, nec felix attulit omen. ς ·
fax quoque, quam tenuit, lacrimoso stridula fumo
usque fuit, nullosque invenit motibus ignes. '
