the emperor at some weakness, folly, or fault, which he says
he is not iree to tell. Some have thought he was indiscreet
-enough to make love to Julia, the brilliant, witty, and erratio
daughter of the emperor, wile ol the grave Agrippa 3 others
that he unfortunately knew too much of some court scandal,
probably connected with Julia or her ill-lamed and ill-tated ·
daughter; others that Augustus as public patron otmorals,
took offence at the somewhat cynical indecorum ot certain

olbis poems. At any rate, the emperor 'was hardened

against all his llatteries and prayers, and aiter an exile ot
about ten years he died at Tomi, A. n. 18.

Besides the poems represented in this volume, Ovid was
the author ot the Ars Amatoria and. the Remedium Amoris Ι
(to which reference has just been made), and ot numerous
“Elegies,'’ including tour books ol letters written in exile
(Ex Ponto Libri iv). As a poet, his tame is tar below that
ot Virgil and Horace, -deservedly, since his loose and easy
verse bears no comparison with the elaborate finish of theirs.
For fancy and fine poetic feeling, however, many ot the
Elegies -both in the Trehte'o and the Amores - show a vein
ol as good quality as either ot his rivals5 while in absolute
ease of handling the artificial structure of Latin verse it may

be doubted whether he has ever had an equal. His chief η

merit, however, is as an excellent story-teller,-·-smooth,
facile, fluent, sometimes, it must be contessed, inordinately
diffuse. As the most celebrated existing collection ot the
most famous fables ot the ancient world, the Metamorphoses,
iu particular, makes the best ol introductions to the nobler
and more difficult verse of Virgil.
