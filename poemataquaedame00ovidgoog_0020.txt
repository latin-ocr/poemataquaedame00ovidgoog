IN nova sert animus mutatas dicere formas
corpora. Di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas)

Ι adspirate meis} primaque ab origine mundi

'ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen.

Anna mare et terras et (quod tegit omnia) caelum,

ι necquicquam nisi pondus iners, congestaque eodem

non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum.
nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan, ιο
nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe,
