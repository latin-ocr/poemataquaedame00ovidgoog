[Ture doom of Niobe reminds one hearer of the vengeance ’
inflicted on certain people of Lycia, who, having refused to Latona
a draught of water from the lake in her extreme thirst, were by
Jupiter turned into frogs (Vl. 313-381); and another of the satyr
Marsyas, who was conquered in music and flayed by Apollo; and
another of the crime of Tantalus, N iobe's father, who caused his'
son Pelops to be served up at meat to the gods (382-411). Pan·
dion of Athens, attacked lor refusing the friendship of Pelops, is
helped by TereuS, king of Thrace, to whom he gives his daughter
Progne to wife. But Tereus, having committed incest with
Progue's sister Philomel, is dreadfully revenged by the two, who
serve to him in a banquet the body of his son ltys; and, pursuing
them for vengeance, all are transformed to birds - Tereus becom-
ing a hoopo'e', Progne a swaHOW, Philomel a nightingale, and Itys
a pheasant; while Pandion, dying of grief, is succeeded hy Erec-
theus (412-676), whose daughter Orithyia is borne away by Boreas
(the North Wind) to Thrace. Here she becomes mother of the
winged heroes Zethes and Calais, who accompany Jason and the
Argonauts in their voyage for the Golden F leece (677-721).]

Arrived at Colchis, Jason is met by the enchantress Medea,
daughter of king Aetes3 wh0, moved by love, secures him by her
enchantments from the Dragon guarding the fleece, and from the
fite-breathing bulls, with which he ploughs the appointed field,
sowing it with serpents’ teeth (VII. 1-122). From these spring up
armed men, who prepare to attack Jason; but he, instructed by
Medea, casts a'stone among them, whereat they perish in mutual
slaughter (123-143). Returning to lolchos with Medea, he en-
treats her to restore to youth his aged father. The magic is
described at length, by which she prepares the juices of miraculous
herbs; and, these proving efficacious, AEson is converted to the
fresh vigor of forty years before (144-293). .
